A FastAPI-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system** that answers user queries using a knowledge base of documents. This project demonstrates how to build a simple RAG engine, return sources, and provide evaluation metrics like precision, recall, MRR, and ROUGE-L.  



 Features

- ✅ **FastAPI backend** with Swagger UI documentation (`/docs`)  
- ✅ **RAGEngine** for document retrieval and answer generation  
- ✅ Handles documents as **strings or dictionaries with metadata**  
- ✅ Returns **answer along with source documents**  
- ✅ Computes **basic evaluation metrics**: precision, recall, MRR, ROUGE-L  
- ✅ Supports **modular project structure** with `src/` folder
